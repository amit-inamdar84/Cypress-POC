Page object pattern.Framework guidelines:
Create a folder page-objects under cypress folder.
Under this folder create two sub folders: pages and components
Under pages, create a file BasePage.js
In BasePage.js, we write shared logic. i.e. the code that will be shared with all test cases.
In components sub folder under page-objects, we write functions to perform actions on elements that are located in the web
component that are common to all pages. Ex: Navigation bar that contains logo and search box.
